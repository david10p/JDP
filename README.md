Android College Planner

"JDP" could stand for either Jonh, David, Peter ... or simply for Just Delightful Planner. Your choice.

We are college students. We'll write this delightful planner for Android phones. If you are a college student, you will thank us later.

Hold tight, the work on this has now commenced!


** Update :: June 5th, 2014 **

The development of JDP was successfully completed as of May 10th, 2014. The group ended up using means other than GITHUB to collaborate on the creation of this Android Planner.
